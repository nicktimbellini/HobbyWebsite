        <h2>Welcome to My Lego Resale Hobby!</h2>
        <p>
            I like to resell and collect Legos. On this site, you’ll learn about how I find rare sets,
            restore them, and offer them for resale. Whether you're a fellow collector or just curious about the hobby,
            there's plenty to explore.

            One of the key aspects of my approach is tracking LEGO prices and market trends. I carefully monitor which sets are nearing retirement, as discontinued sets often see a sharp increase in value once they are no longer in production. By analyzing historical price data, paying attention to fan demand, and keeping up with limited releases, I identify which sets are most likely to appreciate quickly in the aftermarket.

            Timing is everything. I aim to buy promising sets before they retire, ensuring I get them at retail prices or even at a discount when possible. Then, once demand surges post-retirement, I resell them to collectors who missed out or investors looking for high-value pieces. It’s a strategy that requires patience, research, and a deep understanding of the LEGO community, but it’s also incredibly rewarding.
